# AutoOfficeWindows
 
This is a very basic Windows implementation of my AutoOffice server for Windows.  More details on how this is used can be found at https://github.com/jangellx/AutoOfficeDaemon_VaporV3 and https://github.com/jangellx/AutoOffice_ESP8266, as well as http://www.tmproductions.com/projects-blog/2017/3/7/auto-office .  See AutoOfficeWindows.cpp for details about how to set it up.
